### Step 1: Implement the Account Service

#### 1.1 Define the Service

- **Purpose**: Handles user registration, user authentication, and user profile management.
- **Endpoints**:
    - `POST /register`: Registers a new user.
    - `POST /login`: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.
    - `GET /profile`: Retrieves the user's profile information (Requires JWT token).

#### 1.2 Set Up the Project Structure

- Create a new module in your Maven project for the account service.
- Structure your package as follows:
    - `controller`: For your REST controllers.
    - `service`: For your business logic.
    - `repository`: For your data access objects.
    - `model`: For your entity classes.
    - `security`: For your security configuration.

#### 1.3 Implement the User Entity and Repository

- Define a `User` entity with attributes like `id`, `username`, `password`, `email`, etc.
- Create a `UserRepository` interface that extends `MongoRepository` for database operations.

#### 1.4 Implement the Registration and Authentication Logic

- Implement a `UserService` that handles business logic for user registration and authentication.
- Use Spring Security and JWT for secure authentication.
- Implement password hashing and validation.

#### 1.5 Create Controllers

- Create a `UserController` and define the endpoints (`/register`, `/login`, `/profile`).
- Use `@RestController` to make it a RESTful controller.
- Inject `UserService` into the controller to use its methods.

#### 1.6 Security Configuration

- Configure Spring Security to secure your endpoints.
- Set up JWT filters to handle token creation, expiration, and validation.

#### 1.7 Test Your Service

- Write unit tests for your service and repository layers.
- Test your endpoints using Postman or any other API testing tool.

### Step 2: Set Up Service Discovery (Eureka)

#### 2.1 Eureka Server

- Set up a new Maven module for the Eureka server.
- Use Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka to make it a service registry.
- Configure application properties for the Eureka server.

#### 2.2 Register Services with Eureka

- Include Eureka Client in your service's dependencies.
- Configure application properties to register your services with the Eureka server.

### Step 3: Implement Other Services

Follow a similar approach to implement other services like:

- **Wallet Service**: Manages wallet operations like viewing balance, adding funds, and withdrawing funds.
- **Transaction Service**: Handles transaction processing and records.
- **Bill Payment Service**: Manages bill payment functionalities.
- **Notification Service**: Handles sending notifications to users.

For each service:

1. **Define the Service**: Determine the purpose and endpoints.
2. **Set Up the Project Structure**: Create a new module and define the package structure.
3. **Implement the Core Logic**: Create entities, repositories, services, and controllers.
4. **Security and Configuration**: Secure your services and configure them to register with Eureka.
5. **Test Your Service**: Write and run tests to ensure your service is functioning correctly.

### Step 4: Gateway, Circuit Breaker, and Monitoring

- **Gateway**: Use Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul to route requests to your services.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Implement Hystrix for fault tolerance.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate Spring Boot Actuator and possibly ELK stack for monitoring and logging.

### Step 5: Containerization and Orchestration

- **Dockerize Your Services**: Create Dockerfiles for each service.
- **Orchestration**: Optionally, use Kubernetes or Docker Compose for orchestrating your containers.
